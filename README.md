# 📅 PA2: Unix Calendar

This project implements a simple **7-day calendar application in C**, developed as part of UCSD's CSE course assignment [PA2](https://cse29.site/pa2).

The program allows users to manage events through a command-line interface, practicing data structures, time manipulation, and dynamic memory management in C.

## 📝 Project Overview
- Build a **7-day calendar** where each day's events are stored in a **linked list**.
- Enable users to:
  - **Create** new events.
  - **Duplicate** existing events.
  - **Reschedule** events to different times/days.
  - **Delete** events.
  - **Search** for events by time.
- Ensure the calendar properly **avoids scheduling conflicts** (no overlapping events).
- All event times are represented in **Unix time (epoch seconds)**.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Develop proficiency in **C programming**.
- Implement and manage **linked lists** for dynamic data structures.
- Work with **Unix time representations**.
- Practice **modular programming** with header/source files.
- Handle **user input validation** and **error cases**.
- Efficient use of **dynamic memory allocation** and cleanup.
